# Project Setup and Build Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to set up and build the Hello World project using the Processor SDK RTOS for J722S, SysConfig, and the C7000 Compiler.


## 1. Download Required Tools

### Download and Install:

1. **SysConfig:**
   - [Download SysConfig](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SYSCONFIG)

2. **Processor SDK RTOS for J722S:**
   - [Download Processor SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-J722S)

3. **C7000 Compiler:**
   - [Download C7000 CGT](https://www.ti.com/tool/C7000-CGT)

### Installation:

1. **Install SysConfig:**
   - Install the SysConfig tarball into the `ti` directory:

2. **Install C7000 Compiler:**
   - Install the C7000 Compiler tarball into the `ti` directory:

3. **Extract Processor SDK RTOS:**
   - Extract the Processor SDK RTOS tarball into the `ti` directory:

     ```sh
     tar -xf ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j722s-evm-09_02_00_05.tar.gz -C ~/ti
     ```

## 2. Set Environment Variables

Set the environment variables to point to the installed tools.
```sh
export CG_TOOL_ROOT=${HOME}/ti/ti-cgt-c7000_4.1.0.LTS
export SDK_INSTALL_PATH=${HOME}/ti/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j722s-evm-09_02_00_05/mcu_plus_sdk_j722s_09_02_00_59
```


## 3. Navigate to SDK Installation Path

Change to the SDK installation directory:

```sh
cd ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}
```

### Update SysConfig Version

1. Open the `imports.mak` file in a text editor:

   ```sh
   vi imports.mak
   ```

2. Replace `SYSCONFIG_VERSION` with your SysConfig version, e.g., `1.21.0`:

   ```makefile
   SYSCONFIG_VERSION = 1.21.0
   ```

3. Save the changes and exit the editor.

## 4. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the `examples` directory:

```sh
cd ${SDK_INSTALL_PATH}/examples
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone the example project repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ebiroll/hello_beagley.git
```

Change into the project directory:

```sh
cd hello_beagley
```

## 5. Build the Project

Build the project using the following make commands:

```sh
make -s -C j722s-evm/main-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang
make -s -C j722s-evm/c75ss0-0_freertos/ti-c7000
make -s -C j722s-evm/c75ss1-0_freertos/ti-c7000
```

- Ensure all tools and dependencies are correctly installed.
- Consult the documentation provided with the tools for troubleshooting.
- Adjust paths and filenames based on your actual installation and versions.

For further assistance, please refer to the documentation for SysConfig, Processor SDK, and C7000 Compiler, or seek support from the respective forums.
```

This `README.md` file provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the environment, configuring SysConfig, building the project, and testing it on the BeagleBoard. Adjust the paths, versions, and filenames as needed to match your setup.
